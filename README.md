### VAMR 2024 ###

VO Pipeline for VAMR 2024 Mini Project.


Use conda and the provided mini_project.yml file to initiate the conda environment.
It is based on the minimal set of possible libraries needed to get everything working and should be kept as lean as possible.


To use the VO pipeline, download all three datasets from the website and include them in this VAMR2024 folder.

The Pipeline can be run with 
'''
python main.py
'''

And using "--ds 1" or "--ds 2" switches between the datasets. (ds 0 is the standard)
